# Rotating Cube in terminal (notcurses branch)

Seen this online a bunch of times, so wanted to learn how to make it myself.
Will adapt to terminal size, so make the font unreadably small to make it look a little better!

Runs at about ~300fps in my terminal with a tiny little font. Spent quite a bit of time trying to optimize, even adding simple concurrency, but ultimately I just needed to compile with -O3. Still have a lot to learn...
