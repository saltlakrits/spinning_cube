# Rotating Cube in terminal

Seen this online a bunch of times, so wanted to learn how to make it myself.
Will adapt to terminal size, so make the font unreadably small to make it look a little better!

Runs at 60fps with a small font in my terminal, can't get it to go above that though.
Implemented threading for drawing a zbuffer while making a new one, didn't increase performance though.
Chalking this up to limitations of the terminal, but perhaps my program is just really slow!

Learned a lot!
